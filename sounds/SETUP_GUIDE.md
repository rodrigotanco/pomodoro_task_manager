### daily-reset.mp3 - Not Needed!

**The daily reset alert is disabled by default** - no sound file needed.

If you want to enable it later, you can upload a custom sound through the Settings panel in the app.

## üìã STEP 5: Verify Your Files

After completing all steps, your `sounds/` directory should contain:

```
/home/rodrigotanco/Documents/clase/sounds/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ short-break.mp3      ‚úì (Gong + "Take a break")
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ long-break.mp3       ‚úì (Gong + "Take a break")
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work-start.mp3       ‚úì (Gong + "Start workout session")
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-complete.mp3    ‚úì (Applause/clapping)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SETUP_GUIDE.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ QUICK_LINKS.md
```

**Note**: No `daily-reset.mp3` needed - this alert is disabled by default.

## üß™ STEP 6: Test in Your Application

1. Open your Pomodoro Timer application (`index.html`)

   - Task Complete: "Clapping sounds"
4. Click the **"Test"** button for each to preview
5. Adjust volume/duration as needed

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time

- **Total time**: 15-20 minutes

- Step 3 (Combine audio): 7 minutes
- Step 4 (Finalize): 3 minutes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Sound not playing?
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify file is in MP3 format
- Ensure filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5)

### File too large?
- Maximum size: 5MB per file
- Use https://www.freeconvert.com/mp3-compressor to reduce size
- Reduce bitrate to 128 kbps

### Sound cuts off or loops weirdly?
- Check the duration setting in the app
- Adjust "Duration (s)" for that alert type
- Ensure your audio file ends cleanly (no abrupt cut)

### Want to re-record voice?
- Just go back to TTSMaker
- Try different voices for variety
- Experiment with speed/pitch settings

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Keep it short**: 3-5 seconds is ideal for alerts
2. **Test volume**: Record at a consistent volume level
3. **Export quality**: Use 128-192 kbps for MP3 (good balance of quality/size)
4. **Backup**: Keep your source files (gong, voices) in case you want to remix later
5. **Variations**: Create multiple versions and swap them out to keep things fresh

---

## üé® Customization Ideas

- **Different voices**: Try male/female, different accents
- **Multiple gongs**: Use different gong sounds for work vs break
- **Add music**: Brief uplifting music snippet for long breaks
- **Personal touch**: Record your own voice instead of TTS
- **Themed sets**: Create morning/evening versions with different energy levels

## ‚úÖ You're Done!

Once all files are in place, your Pomodoro Timer will automatically use these custom sounds. Users can still upload their own custom sounds if they prefer, but yours will be the high-quality defaults!

Enjoy your personalized Pomodoro Timer! üçÖ‚è∞
